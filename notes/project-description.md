#  *Swarm Task Scheduler*: Project Description
## Target & Objectives

This project aims to compare several algorithms discussed in the paper "Exploring Swarm Intelligence Optimization Techniques for Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing: Algorithms, Performance Analysis, and Future Prospects" by Farida Siddiqi Prity, K. M. Aslam Uddin, and Nishu Nath. The primary goal is to analyze the resource costs associated with task scheduling in cloud computing.

The paper provides examples of algorithms and mentions the resources where they were implemented and tested. This project will review the results presented in the paper and analyze how the algorithms were applied. Based on this analysis, one approach will be selected for implementation. The chosen algorithm will then be used to simulate a task-scheduling application to gain insights into its practical performance.

The research and implementation process will be thoroughly documented in a written report and presented through a formal presentation.

## Methods & Technologies

The approach involves applying the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in a program. The primary objective is to identify the global minimum of a given fitness function. The program will be developed in either C or Java, as these programming languages offer familiarity and reliability. After implementation, the application will be tested in a cloud simulation environment, such as CloudSim. The algorithm’s performance will then be evaluated, with a particular focus on cost-efficiency, as recommended in the main source.

The main source also refers to additional literature where PSO was applied using similar simulation tools. These resources will serve as references for evaluating the algorithm’s performance in various aspects, including reliability, makespan, cost, security, load balancing, and energy efficiency, as outlined in the original paper [p. 349-350].
