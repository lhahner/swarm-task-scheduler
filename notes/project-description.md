# Swarm Task Scheduler: Project Description
## Target & Objectives

This project aims to implement a swarm optimization algorithm and 
compare it to one or two other swarm optimization algorithms discussed
in the paper "Exploring Swarm Intelligence-Optimization Techniques 
for Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing: Algorithms, Performance 
Analysis, and Future Prospects" by Farida Siddiqi Prity, 
K. M. Aslam Uddin, and Nishu Nath.

The paper provides examples of algorithms and mentions the resources 
where they were implemented and tested. This project will utilize the 
results and references from the mentioned paper for further analysis, 
evaluation criteria, and proposed technologies to use.

The research and implementation process will be thoroughly documented 
in a written report and presented through a formal presentation.
  
## Methods & Technologies

The approach involves applying the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 
algorithm in a program. The primary objective is to identify the 
global minimum of a given fitness function, which involves the 
scheduling of tasks in a cloud environment to keep the usage of 
performance indicators low, e.g., resource cost or memory consumption.

The program will be developed in either C or Java, as these 
programming languages offer familiarity and reliability. After 
implementation, the application will be tested in a cloud simulation 
environment, such as CloudSim. The algorithmâ€™s performance will then 
be evaluated, with a focus on cost efficiency, as recommended in the 
mentioned main source.
