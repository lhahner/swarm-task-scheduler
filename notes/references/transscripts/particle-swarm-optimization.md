# Particle Swarm Optimization: Summarized

- There is a Set of canidates which persue a pursue a solution.
- Each particle flies in a search area
- Searching for a solution to land
- So the search are is the set of possible solutions
- As a whole the group represents the changing solutions
- The generations (iterations), each particle tracks its personal solution (optimum), as well as the solution (optimum) in the swarm.
- Then modyfing the speed and the position.
- This is done until getting the global optimum.
