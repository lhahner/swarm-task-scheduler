## PSO application for Task-Schedueling

This is how a particle swarm optimization does. Similar to the flock of birds looking for food, we start with a number of random points on the plane (call them particles) and let them look for the minimum point in random directions. At each step, every particle should search around the minimum point it ever found as well as around the minimum point found by the entire swarm of particles. After certain iterations, we consider the minimum point of the function as the minimum point ever explored by this swarm of particles.
